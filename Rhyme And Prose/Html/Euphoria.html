        Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence<br>
        The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'<br>
        You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful<br>
        I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle<br>
        Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale<br>
        A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now<br>
        You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted<br>
        Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection<br>
        I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em<br>
        I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness<br>
        Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too<br>
        But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you<br>

        Shoo, shoo, shoo<br>

        [Verse 1]
        </p><p class="text-center">
        Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay<br>
        Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay<br>
        I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay<br>
        Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay<br>
        Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay<br>
        Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway<br>
        And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame<br>
        Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?<br>
        Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play<br>
        Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?<br>
        Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?<br>
        Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight<br>
        I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns<br>
        Then hop online like "Pray for my city," he fakin' for likes and digital hugs<br>
        His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done<br>
        Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky<br>
        I'll park his son<br>
        The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way<br>
        I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes<br>
        Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage<br>
        I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave<br>
        Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted<br>
        What is it? The braids?<br>
        I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay<br>
        It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage<br>
        I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh<br>
        It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh<br>
        I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh<br>
        You know I got language barriers, huh<br>
        It's no accent you can sell me, huh<br>
        Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh<br>
        I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly<br>
        I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef<br>
        Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T<br>
        You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me<br>
        He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet<br>
        We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way<br>
        I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint<br>
        This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest<br>
        It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater<br>
        I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress<br>
        I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct<br>
        We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women<br>
        And notice, I said "we," it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'<br>
        How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?<br>
        How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?<br>
        I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough<br>
        You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'<br>
        Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one<br>
        Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from<br>
        V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one<br>
        Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk<br>

        [Verse 2]
        </p><p class="text-center">
        Remember?<br>
        Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?<br>
        Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch<br>
        I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous<br>
        Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with<br>
        I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress<br>
        Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address<br>
        I even hate when you say the word "nigga," but that's just me, I guess<br>
        Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess<br>
        Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed<br>
        Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat<br>
        I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet<br>
        Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)<br>
        When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches<br>
        I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em<br>
        Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya<br>
        You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga<br>
        Try cease and desist on the "Like That" record?<br>
        Ho, what? You ain't like that record?<br>
        "Back To Back," I like that record<br>
        I'ma get back to that, for the record<br>
        Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?<br>
        That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
        Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you<br>
        Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you<br>
        Am I battlin' ghost or AI?<br>
        Nigga feelin' like Joel Osteen<br>
        Funny, he was in a film called A.I.<br>
        And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him<br>
        I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin<br>
        Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders<br>
        Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence<br>
        What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it<br>
        Pick a nigga off one at a time with it<br>
        We can be on a three-hour time difference<br>
        Don't speak on the family, crodie<br>
        It can get deep in the family, crodie<br>
        Talk about me and my family, crodie?<br>
        Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie<br>
        I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie<br>
        Tell me you're cheesin', fam<br>
        We can do this right now on the camera, crodie<br>
        Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas<br>
        I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm<br>
        Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food<br>
        Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too<br>
        If you take it there, I'm takin' it further<br>
        Psst, that's something you don't wanna do<br>

        Ooh<br>
