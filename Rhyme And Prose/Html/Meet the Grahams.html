        Dear Adonis<br>
        I'm sorry that that man is your father, let me be honest<br>
        It takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive<br>
        I look at him and wish your grandpa woulda wore a condom<br>
        I'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind him<br>
        Life is hard, I know, the challenge is always gon' beat us home<br>
        Sometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grown<br>
        Hey, you're a good kid that need good leadership<br>
        Let me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shit<br>
        Never let a man piss on your leg, son<br>
        Either you die right there or pop that man in the head, son<br>
        Never fall in the escort business, that's bad religion<br>
        Please remember, you could be a bitch even if you got bitches<br>
        Never code-switch, whether right or wrong, you're a Black man<br>
        Even if it don't benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline<br>
        Don't cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did<br>
        Don't pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership<br>
        Understand, no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands, that's law<br>
        Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms<br>
        Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again, be sure<br>
        Five percent will comprehend, but ninety-five is lost<br>
        Be proud of who you are, your strength come from within<br>
        Lotta superstars that's real, but your daddy ain't one of them<br>
        And you nothing like him, you'll carry yourself as king<br>
        Can't understand me right now? Just play this when you eighteen<br>

        Dear Sandra<br>
        Your son got some habits, I hope you don't undermine them<br>
        Especially with all the girls that's hurt inside this climate<br>
        You a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment<br>
        With emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded<br>
        Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator<br>
        Even usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor<br>
        I think you should ask for more paper, and more paper<br>
        And more, uh, more paper<br>
        I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions<br>
        Psychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim<br>
        You raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis<br>
        Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen<br>
        Mm-mm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die<br>
        Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life<br>
        He hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish<br>
        Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better<br>
        He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance<br>
        A child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them<br>
        And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'<br>
        Fuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose<br>
        I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret<br>
        It's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it<br>
        They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender<br>
        Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas<br>
        To any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister<br>
        Or better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones<br>
        Katt Williams said, "Get you the truth," so I'ma get mines<br>
        The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time<br>
        Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away<br>
        To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away<br>
        They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away<br>
        I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe<br>

        Dear baby girl
        I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world<br>
        He don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure<br>
        He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs<br>
        Try destroyin' families rather than takin' care of his own<br>
        Should be teachin' you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you<br>
        Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you<br>
        Instead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve<br>
        I wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind<br>
        You got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind<br>
        'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion<br>
        Money's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to<br>
        His father prolly didn't claim him neither<br>
        History do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason<br>
        But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child<br>
        Give him grace, this the reason I made Mr. Morale<br>
        So our babies like you can cope later<br>
        Give you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later<br>
        I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior<br>
        Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation<br>
        You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain<br>
        I'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains<br>
        Yes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right<br>
        And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say "more life"<br>

        Dear Aubrey<br>
        I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party<br>
        But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body<br>
        This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game<br>
        But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name<br>
        Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?<br>
        Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you<br>
        And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home<br>
        Thirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old<br>
        You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems<br>
        Bad with money, whorehouse<br>
        Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start<br>
        But I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom<br>
        I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'<br>
        Crave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'<br>
        No dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in<br>
        No secret handshakes with your friend<br>
        No culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother<br>
        Identity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya<br>
        The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas<br>
        Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman<br>
        You a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?<br>
        You embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us<br>
        Take that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements<br>
        Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in<br>
        'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery<br>
        You lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury<br>
        You lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members<br>
        They all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em<br>
        You lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh<br>
        You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come<br>
        You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help<br>
        Fuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself<br>
