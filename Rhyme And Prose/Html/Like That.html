            Pussy niggas told, ain't gon' wake up out they sleep
            You can't hear that switch, but you can hear them niggas scream
            All my hoes do shrooms, nigga, all my hoes do coke
            Twenty-carat ring, I put my fingers down her throat (Uh, uh, uh)
            If I lose a carat, she might choke (Uh, uh, uh)
            I know she gon' swallow, she a G.O.A.T. (Uh, uh, uh)
            Freeband nigga, bring the racks in
            Got the shooters in the corner like the pack in
            She think 'cause she exotic bitch, she attractive
            That's that shit'll get you put up out the section, brrt
            And the motto still the same
            Ball like I won a championship game

            I put her on the gang, she get fucked for a chain
            Got your girl in this bitch, she twirlin' on the dick
            I got syrup in this bitch, turn up in this bitch
            And we brought the 'Ercs in this bitch, get murked in this bitch
            All these pointers on me, baby, you know it's game time
            Bring a friend, bitch, we fucked 'em at the same time
            I'm a different nigga, no, we not the same kind
            You can have that lil'— if she ain't mine (Yeah)

            These niggas talkin' out of they necks
            Don't pull no coffin out of your mouth, I'm way too paranoid for a threat

            D-O-T, the money, power, respect
            The last one is better
            Say, it's a lot of goofies with a check
            I mean, ah, I hope them sentiments symbolic
            Ah, my temperament bipolar, I choose violence
            Okay, let's get it up, it's time for him to prove that he's a problem
            Niggas clickin' up, but cannot be legit, no 40 Water, tell 'em
            Ah, yeah, huh, yeah, get up with me
            Fuck sneak dissin', first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches
            I crash out like, "Fuck rap," diss Melle Mel if I had to
            Got 2TEEZ with me, I'm snatchin' chains and burnin' tattoos, it's up
            Lost too many soldiers not to play it safe
            If he walk around with that stick, it ain't André 3K
            Think I won't drop the location? I still got PTSD
            Motherfuck the big three, nigga, it's just big me

            Came in banging dope, niggas was young, slangin' powder
            Walk in the strip club, make it rain for three hours
            Locked in and now I got my Phantom and my driver
            Perc'd out, took chances in my hood like Nevada
            Surfed out outside, white interior, lasagna
            Hundred thousands, I just cashed out on designer
            Gotta devour, nigga, I learned that in the jungle
            Once I sell this load, that's a million in a week
